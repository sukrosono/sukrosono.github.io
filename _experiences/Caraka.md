I am creating a custom app with Codeigniter 3. Which the main purpose is to simplify creating report in 3 form.
In a PDF, Spreadsheet and .doc . The report is taken by a health care and saved on MySQL, the health care can later read the data from the web interface or view monthly data on spreadsheet.

Cleverly PDF format is the standard, it asked by the client. The upper organization is smart enough to recognize "portable" in PDF. I am big fan of opensource and have huge tendency to hate windows.

This application is classifying the data by the medical check up.

The project is done and asked before covid19 hit us.
